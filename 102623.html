  adding outside games onto the school ipads
    </h1>
    <p>
I wanted to get outside apps onto the school ipad 
      (which has a shitton of useless restrictions,
      part of why MNblocker was started). Basically 
      sideloading and I wanted to get flappybird on 
      the home screen. After a bit of research I found 
      you could download a zip file for flappy bird on the
      <a href="https://archive.org">internet archive</a>.</p> <p>
      Once downloaded, makes sure its not in the “On My iPad” 
      section in Garageband. (on the school ipads, the only way 
      to view and edit files is on garageband. annoying but it works
      ig) It has to be on onedrive. This is really only possible if 
      you have a phone or computer or your own personal device. On your 
      personal device install onedrive and extract the zip file you downloaded 
      from the archive. Then you can move it into On My iPad (or else it wont 
      display in garageband). Then you can rename the unzipped file to .app or 
      something else I don’t now yet. This is all very new. New stuff to be done 
      in the coming weeks, hopefully itll be figured out soon.
