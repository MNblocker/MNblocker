    <h1 class="hometitle">adding outside games onto the school ipads</h1>
    <p>
      (~kerbalis brief instructions that she got from me lol -nerddern~) I
      wanted to get outside apps onto the school ipad (which has a shitton of
      useless restrictions, part of why MNblocker was started). Basically
      sideloading and I wanted to get flappybird on the home screen. After a bit
      of research I found you could download a zip file for flappy bird on the
      <a href="archive.org">internet archive</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once downloaded, makes sure its not in the “On My iPad” section in
      Garageband. (on the school ipads, the only way to view and edit files is
      on garageband. annoying but it works ig) It has to be on onedrive. This is
      really only possible if you have a phone or computer or your own personal
      device. On your personal device install onedrive and extract the zip file
      you downloaded from the archive. Then you can move it into On My iPad (or
      else it wont display in garageband). Then you can rename the unzipped file
      to .app or something else I don’t now yet. This is all very new. New stuff
      to be done in the coming weeks, hopefully itll be figured out soon.
    </p>
    what oh helo, this is isaac. after editing kerbalis's a bit i realized i
    should just start my own section so here are my instructions (btw i suck at
    code so idk how to create a new line and stuff) hopefully kerbalis will edit
    this after i write this lol
    <p>yippeee i figured something out is this a paragraph??? anyway!</p>

    <p>Step 1: download flappy bird</p>
    <p>Flappy Bird v1.3.ipa</p>

    <p>
      Step 2: save to files in OneDrive (not the OneDrive app, in the OneDrive
      section in files.) (ignore the shitty image)
